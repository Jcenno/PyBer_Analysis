# PyBer_Analysis

## Introduction
This analysis was done in three parts. First we created a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type. Then we created a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type. Finally we can do analysis on this data to see how the differences we find can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

The data we are analysing is as follows:
- Total Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare Per Ride
- Average Fare Per Driver

Here is the code we used to find this data:

## Summary of Data
Here we can see a summary of the data showing ride sharing in the different city types. Rural areas have a higher average fare, but a lower total number of rides with those numbers decreasing and increasing respectively for Suburban and Urban areas. This is most likely due to the density of the population and travel distance requirements for those areas.

### Total Fare by City Type
This image allows us to see the total fare for each city type. From the image we can tell that even though the average fare may be lower in Urban areas, the Urban areas have a higher total fare.

## Recommendations
- Suburban drivers could be rewarded for taking on rural routes. Giving a bonus to make up for the fact you may not find a return fare. The same can be done for Urban drivers to get them to take Suburban and Rural fares.
- The company could be rewarded for putting an emphasis on improving their Urban operations since a majority of their revenue comes from there. An increase in effeciency will have a better effect in the Urban environment than either of the other two regions.
